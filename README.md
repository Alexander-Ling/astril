### Description:
astril is a python package designed to streamline radiology image pre-processing (i.e. scan type identification, DICOM -> NIFTI conversion, co-registration, skull stripping, normalization, etc.), segmentation, and model training. The package was built to make it easy for other researchers to trivially apply our glioblastoma segmentation algorithms to their own brain MRI scans while also providing the tools to refine our models or train their own from scratch. Most of the functions in this package should also work with radiology images other than MRIs, though the functionality and models are currently tailred specifically to MRI images.

A detailed description of the package and instructions for its use will be provided in the coming months as we finalize the package and its associated manuscript.
